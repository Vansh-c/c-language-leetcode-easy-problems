// processing has 4 basic steps 
// 1. preprocessing    2.compilation   3. assembly   4.Linking 

// preprocessing : it includes methods like removal of comments , expansion of macros , include useful files.
// Compilation: assembly level instruciton are generated . 
// Assembly: stores the instuctuon in .o and .exe file ,printf function are not yet resolved , ALI are converted to machine code. 
// Linking: links the function implementation . 


// c preprocessor comes under the action of the actual compilation processs. c processor is not actually the part of compiler. 
// it is a text substitution tool . 
// All preprocessor commands begin with the hash (#) symbol.
