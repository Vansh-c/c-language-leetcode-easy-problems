// WHY DO WE NEED A FILE : 
// file is used to store data and information . 
// file is used to read and access data anytime from the hard disk . 
// Files make it easier for the programmer to store  and access content without losing it on program termination. 


// When a c program is terminated , the data stored in ram is lost . 
// Storing a file will preserve our data even after the program terminates . 
// RAM is not able to handle very large amount of data due to its small size relative to the hard disk . 
// Its is easier to transfer data than files . 


// there a two type of files : 
// text files : these are plain text files
// Binary files : these are more secure files as compared to later .


// In c we perform high level operations like : creating a new file , opening a file , closing the file , and reading from and writing to a file .
